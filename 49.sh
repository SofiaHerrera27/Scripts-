# Inserts a blank line between paragraphs of a single-spaced text file.
# Usage: $0 <FILENAME

MINLEN=60        # Change this value? It's a judgment call.
#  Assume lines shorter than $MINLEN characters ending in a period
#+ terminate a paragraph. See exercises below.

  echo "$line"   # Output the line itself.

# An update to Bash broke the previous version of this script. Ouch!
# Thank you, Halim Srama, for pointing this out and suggesting a fix.

# Exercises:
# ---------
#  1) The script usually inserts a blank line at the end
#+    of the target file. Fix this.
#  2) Line 17 only considers periods as sentence terminators.
#     Modify this to include other common end-of-sentence characters,
#+    such as ?, !, and ".
