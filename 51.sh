# Exercise:
# --------
#  As it stands, this script converts *all* the files in the current

#  Modify it to work *only* on files with a ".mac" suffix.

#!/bin/bash
# Batch convert into different graphic formats.
# Assumes imagemagick installed (standard in most Linux distros).

INFMT=png   # Can be tif, jpg, gif, etc.
OUTFMT=pdf  # Can be tif, jpg, gif, pdf, etc.

for pic in *"$INFMT"
do
  p2=$(ls "$pic" | sed -e s/\.$INFMT//)
  # echo $p2
